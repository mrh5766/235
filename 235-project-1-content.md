<h1>Space Battle</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
Space Battle is a game in which the player fights an intense battle against a boss spaceship. The
player's dodging skills will be put to the test, requiring the player to survive long enough to take 
the boss down. Are you up for the challenge? Try it now!


Proposal:
<h1>Space Battle</h1>
<h2>High Concept</h2>
The user dodges and shoots to defeat a boss.
<h2>Genre</h2>
The genres are action, shooter, and avoidance.
<h2>Platform</h2>
The platform will be desktop only, as controls would be significantly more difficult to implement in
a satisfying manner on mobile.
<h2>Story</h2>
The player is a spaceship fighting against a boss spaceship in order to defeat it.
<h2>Esthetics</h2>
The graphics style will be pixel art. It will have 8-bit music, and will have sounds to indicate
shooting and the boss's abilities.
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
The player can shoot and move to avoid boss abilities. For controls, the player can move using the
wasd keys, and aim and shoot using the mouse. The player is taught the controls in a
tutorial screen before the game starts. To beat the game, the player must learn the boss's attacks
and how to dodge them. For example, the boss might have an attack where it creates lasers on the
screen, with an image showing where the lasers would be beforehand so that the player could dodge.
The player will have a temporary boost, such as a shield or a speed boost that will go on
cooldown. The cooldown will have a visual indicator.

<h2>Other</h2>
I don't really have anything else to say about the game. I'm just trying not to make it too
complicated, especially because I know nothing about Javascript yet.
<h2>About the Developer</h2>
My name is Michael Hrehocik. I'm a sophomore game design student, and know C#, C++, and Java, and the
tools Visual Studio and Unity. I'm interested in programming, rather than any sort of creative
elements such as visual or sound design, since I'm not a creative person. However, I still enjoy
programming games.

<h2>Sources</h2>
I used [the w3validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#file) to validate my
code. For any issues I had, I also used [w3](https://www.w3schools.com/) for
documentation. Finally, I
used [coolers.co](https://coolors.co/) to generate my color template. My
images and formatting were created by me.
